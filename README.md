Although it seems awfully primitive now, we were told to be able to load as many items from a file as our instructor desired.  If she wanted to add more, then she could by accessing the file and adding them, and she stated that she would add the information in correctly.  Everyone else in the course decided to have the item slot number be a part of each item line in the file, and I was the only one to figure out a solution to dynamically load in file numbers to actually be able to load in as many items as desired without worrying about a duplicate item slot number entry.
